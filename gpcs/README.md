# The GlobalProtect Cloud Service (GPCS) template

 This template provides three configuration elements for Remote Network
 internet access:

 1. Baseline: initial service infrastructure, Device-group, and Template Stack configuration

 2. Remote Network: reference IKE and IPSEC configuration with site onboarding

 3. Reference CPE configuration snippets for IPSEC connectivity to GPCS

Included in the template configuration is the
[IronSkillet](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) day one configuration.


**NOTE:** This assumes the Panorama platform is operational with the GPCS
plugin installed and licensed.
